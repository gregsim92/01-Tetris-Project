#####Welcome to my Front End Project!#####

Here I created a basic version of tetris,
the classic falling block puzzle game.

The game has event listeners tied to the arrow keys, 
spacebar, and enter key in order to interact with the Canvas
gameboard.

Basic collision detection has been implemented, so blocks won't pass the boundaries of the board,
or occupy the same space as an existing block.

More features are planned and will be implemented in the near future.



Enjoy!
